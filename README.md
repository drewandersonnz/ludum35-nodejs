# For The Glory

* https://ludum35-onlycentral.rhcloud.com/

A game for Ludum Dare 35.

## Notes

* Website and game, start to finish, from idea to deployment, in under 48 hours.
* This code was written quickly alongside the Unity game project
* Attempted to learn:
  * OpenShift applications on Red Hat Cloud
  * Node.js Jade template engine
  * Node.js modules for MySQL and Sequelize
  * Node.js and OpenShift MySQL integration
  * Writing a website (not an API) in Node.js
* Yes credentials are commited in this repo
  * The OpenShift account is temporary for the purposes of Ludum 35
  * I didn't realise at the time how to integrate OpenShift credentials in the codebase
  * This repo was added to GitHub quickly for review purposes, I haven't removed the commits from Git
